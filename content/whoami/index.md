I gained my first coding experiences when I was about 15 years old, trying to set up my first wordpress site.
In school I built and programmed a robot, and decided to study business informatics in cooperation with Otto GmbH & Co. KG.

#### 2014 - 2018
In Oct 2014 I started my bachelor of science, in collaboration with Otto - the second biggest E-Commerce shop in germany.
At work I was able to try out, what I learnt at the university and already gained a lot of
practical experience that way.

I supported the following teams:

- Android App Development
- Tracking with Kafka and Scala
- Quality (Performance, Load, Robustness & Security)

I finished my bachelor of science in business informatics at the beginning of 2018
and also achieved the *Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching Essentials (CCNA)* Certification.

##### Thesis
I wrote my bachelor thesis on credential stuffing at the Otto Security Team, where I also programmed a prototype, based on machine learning.

#### 2018 - Now
After I finished my bachelor, I continued working for the webapplication security team at otto.
I gained experience in the following areas:

- Giving stakeholder specific security trainings
- Developing & automating security applications in Python
- Security Analysis in Splunk and Kibana
- Consulting development teams (e.g. threat modelling)
- Internal security talks
- Incident response

As most of the technology is hosted by AWS, I also gained experience regarding AWS Cloudsecurity.
Therefore I also achieved the *AWS Security Fundamentals (Second Edition)* Certification.
